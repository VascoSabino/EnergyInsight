# EnergyInsight

With EnergyInsight (MATLAB), you can navigate ENERGY and EXERGY datasets effortlessly. 

Choose from categories like total energy, energy by sector, total exergy, exergy by sector, and Penn World Table.

It's over 25 countries from 1960 to 2019. The ENERGY data is brought by the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the EXERGY by the people of Exergy Economics (https://exergyeconomics.wordpress.com/).

For energy researchers, students, and professionals.
