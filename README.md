1. The program reads the Penn Table as it is downloaded from the website. No changes are made; it is raw: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en

2. The program reads the energy and exergy .csv files.

The .excel and .csv formats must be followed. 

The program is robust, adjusting to new variables and years as it is updated. The only way it will stop working is if the format is really changed (in theory). If the program is not reading correctly, compare the new files with the original ones. Pay special attention to special characters, mainly quotation marks, which should be avoided.
